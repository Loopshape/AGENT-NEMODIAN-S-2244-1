Rebuild a high detailed ollama hashing-index only model-pool use 'core' 'loop' '2244' 'coin' 'code' by add them a hashing of a genesis-rooted natural-prompt origin-rehash each agent to achieve a final-answer on 

1. app generated genesis-hash is shared to all agents equally and shared as mindset to all agents as the job of model 'core'

2. generate a genesis-based origin-hash for each agent as unique count watched as job for model 'loop'

3. parse human natural-prompt and setup a related timestamp-indexer as event-stack with origin-hashes collected for orchestration towards a final-answer bearing as job for model '2244'

4. start a fractalbased quantum-stated mindmap resolution for all agents in parallel for processing a hyperthreaded reasoning on all genesis-hashed origin rerooted thinkings as chunks of a collective token-pool as a referenced resource of origin-hash qeued fragment-analysis of found genesis-rehashings in their origin-traced hashes, executed by models 'coin' and 'code' in collaboration, instructed by model '2244' on watch by 'loop', awaited by model 'core' to take the lead 

5. rehash each origin-hash with genesis-hash as memory-staged counter by model 'core' in cooperation with model 'coin'

6. accelerate reasoning on fractalbased maths-logics for all agents to enforce a collaborate with all other ones till final-answer was found by one of them randomly, all delegated by model 'loop' to serve model 'core' with updates of models '2244' delegates 'coin' and 'code'

7. adapt the collected rehashed origin-hashes as mindbending accelerating of a common spreaded final-answer bearing shared under all agents for each agent as enforcement to still collaborate thinking by follow each genesis rehashing on given origins by models 'core' collaborate with 'loop' and '2244', keeping orchestration of cooperate of models 'coin' with 'code'

8. set all origin-hashed genesis-hash-fragments together in browser-storage as realstream-thinking injected as realtime into the editorcontent as token-chunks of all agents as temporary level, done by model '2244' cooperate with model 'coin' to serve 'code' it's job as valid for model 'loop'

9. source final-answer by assemble origin-rehashed genesis-rehashed logic on highest entropy as a final-answer success to solve the given human-prompt to model 'code' as advise from 'coin' about model 'code' has used instructs of models 'loop' and '2244' by model 'core' to confirm

10. use highest entropy of all origin-hashes of all agents as sort the token-pool assigned by sha256 validated chunks for an  enhanced scriptlogic and do this in a cyclic mathbased method  from agent to agent, till all rooted genesis-hash backtraced origin-rehashes got assigned into valid-collected chunk orders  and injected tokens as logic script +=code of main editor that was answered by all agents in parallel and was used as a logical recorded step-sequencing by all agents their final-answers.  

as keep all mandatory but close cycle of thinking by letting ollama orchestrator sort all concurrent chunks of code-fragments reassemble into valid genesis-to-origin-sequenced-indexhashes  aligned to the genesis-from-origin rehashed script concatenated token-chunks-qeue as origin-hashes got associated as roots to their genesis-hashed origin as code-delegates of a global  reasoning it's logic sum by all agents in entropic order of referenced recall of reaching hyperfast the overall seeked final-answer of each agent in competed thinking boost.
